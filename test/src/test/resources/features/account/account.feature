  @createcryptoaccount
  Scenario Outline: Create crypto account
    When I create a new account with balance <amount> tℏ
    Then the new balance should reflect cryptotransfer of <amount>
    And the mirror node REST API should return the list of accounts
    Then the mirror node REST API should return the balances
    Examples:
      | amount |
      | 10     |

  @critical @release @acceptance @cryptotransfer
  Scenario Outline: Validate simple CryptoTransfer
    Given I send <amount> tℏ to <accountName>
    Then the mirror node REST API should return status <httpStatusCode> for the crypto transfer transaction
    And the new balance should reflect cryptotransfer of <amount>
    Examples:
      | amount | accountName | httpStatusCode |
      | 1      | "ALICE"     | 200            |
