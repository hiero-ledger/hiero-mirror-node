Feature: in-equivalence tests

  Scenario Outline: Validate in-equivalence system accounts for balance, extcodesize, extcodecopy, extcodehash
  and selfdestruct op codes
    Given I successfully create selfdestruct contract
    Given I successfully create equivalence call contract
    Then the mirror node REST API should return status 200 for the contracts creation
    Then I verify the equivalence contract bytecode is deployed
    Then I verify the selfdestruct contract bytecode is deployed
    Then I execute selfdestruct and set beneficiary to <accountNum> num
    Then I execute balance opcode to system account <strictSystemAccountNum> num would return 0
    Then I verify extcodesize opcode against a system account <accountNum> num returns 0
    Then I verify extcodecopy opcode against a system account <accountNum> num returns empty bytes
    Then I verify extcodehash opcode against a system account <accountNum> num returns empty bytes
    Examples:
      | accountNum  | strictSystemAccountNum |
      | "1"         | "1"                    |
      | "10"        | "10"                   |
      | "358"       | "358"                  |
      | "750"       | "749"                  |
      | "999"       | "750"                  |

#   Separated scenario as it needs to be executed only once
  Scenario Outline: Validate in-equivalence for selfdestruct and balance against contract
    Given I successfully create selfdestruct contract
    Then I verify the selfdestruct contract bytecode is deployed
    Given I successfully create equivalence call contract
    Then I verify the equivalence contract bytecode is deployed
    Then the mirror node REST API should return status 200 for the contracts creation
    Then I execute balance opcode against a contract with balance
    Then I execute selfdestruct and set beneficiary to the deleted contract address
